  - Hard to discover new patterns
  
  ANN Strengths:
  + Highly accurate (~99.4% accuracy)
  + Learns patterns from data
  + Flexible and adaptable
  - Hard to explain (black box)
  - Needs lots of training data
  
  Hybrid Result:
  ‚úì 96.8% accuracy
  ‚úì Explainable with reasoning
  ‚úì Robust fallback if one fails
  ```

- **5 Combination Strategies:**
  1. Weighted Average (60% Fuzzy, 40% ANN)
  2. Fuzzy Dominant (70% Fuzzy, 30% ANN)
  3. ANN Dominant (30% Fuzzy, 70% ANN)
  4. Confidence Weighted (adaptive based on confidence)
  5. Adaptive (context-aware, used by default)

- **Read time:** 10 minutes
- **Questions to answer:**
  - Why not just use ANN alone?
