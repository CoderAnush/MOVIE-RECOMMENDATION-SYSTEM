# ðŸš€ How to Create Your GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `movie-recommendation-system`
3. Description: `Production-ready hybrid movie recommendation system with Fuzzy Logic + ANN`
4. Set to **Public** (to showcase your work)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Copy and paste these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/movie-recommendation-system.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload
- Visit your new repository on GitHub
- You should see all 21 files uploaded
- The README.md will display your project overview
- Your trained ANN model (simple_ann_model.keras) will be included

## ðŸŽ¯ What Gets Uploaded:
âœ… All source code (Python files)
âœ… Trained ANN model (3.9KB)
âœ… Fuzzy logic system (47 rules)
âœ… Frontend demo files
âœ… Documentation and README
âœ… Dataset summary (not the large data files)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Next Steps:
Once uploaded, your repository will showcase:
- Complete hybrid recommendation system
- Real trained models (not mock)
- Production-ready code
- Professional documentation

Perfect foundation to continue with the todo list!
