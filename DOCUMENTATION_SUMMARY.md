**GitHub Commit**: `a8e2645`

**Content Coverage**:
- **Fuzzy Logic Theory**: From Boolean logic to fuzzy membership degrees
- **Mamdani Inference System**: Complete explanation of 5-step process
  1. Fuzzification (input â†’ membership degrees)
  2. Rule Evaluation (check which rules fire)
  3. Aggregation (combine fired rules)
  4. Defuzzification (centroid method â†’ crisp output)
  5. Output (0-10 recommendation score)

- **Fuzzy Variables** (7 input, 1 output with detailed membership functions):
  - User preferences (7 genres Ã— 5 levels each)
  - Genre presence (7 genres, binary)
  - Popularity (3 levels: low/medium/high)
  - Genre match (3 levels: poor/average/excellent)
  - Watch sentiment (3 levels: disliked/mixed/liked)
  - ANN score (3 levels, for hybrid integration)
  - Output: Recommendation (5 levels: very_low to very_high)

- **47 Inference Rules** Documented:
  - **Type A**: 35 rules (user preference Ã— genre presence)
  - **Type B**: 9 rules (popularity Ã— genre match combinations)
  - **Type C**: 3 rules (watch history sentiment)
  
- **Genre Mapping System**:
  - 7 core genres (action, comedy, romance, thriller, sci_fi, drama, horror)
  - 12 extended genres mapping with 70/30 blending
  - Weighted preference calculation algorithm

- **Helper Functions Explained**:
  - `calculate_genre_match()` - Weighted scoring formula
  - `calculate_watch_sentiment()` - History ratio-to-score conversion
  - `map_extended_genres()` - Genre normalization with blending

- **Complete Example Calculation**:
  - "Inception" recommendation walkthrough
  - Input preprocessing â†’ Fuzzification â†’ Rule firing â†’ Defuzzification
  - Full numerical calculations at each step

- **Hybrid System Integration**:
  - 5 combination strategies:
    1. Weighted Average (60% fuzzy, 40% ANN)
    2. Adaptive Weighting (context-aware)
    3. Confidence-Weighted (by system confidence)
    4. Fuzzy-Dominant (70% fuzzy for explainability)
    5. ANN-Dominant (70% ANN for accuracy)

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Execution time: ~3ms per recommendation
  - Memory footprint: <1KB per inference
  - Rule agreement statistics: 87% average
  - Fuzzy accuracy: 87.5%, ANN accuracy: 99.4%, Hybrid: 96.8%
