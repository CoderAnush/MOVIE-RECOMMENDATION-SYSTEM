# 🎯 Genre-Based Filtering - FIXED

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Same movies were being recommended regardless of genre preferences
- Movies with disliked genres were still appearing in recommendations
- No strong filtering based on user's high/low genre preferences

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Strict Genre Matching** (`calculate_genre_score`)
- ❌ **Rejects movies without genre info** (score: 0.0)
- 🚫 **Penalizes movies with disliked genres** (< 4/10 preference)
  - If movie has ANY disliked genre → score drops to 0.1
- ✅ **Requires strong match for high preferences** (>= 7/10)
  - If user has high preferences but movie doesn't match → score: 0.2
- 🎯 **Returns low scores for poor matches** (0.1 instead of 0.3)

```python
# Example:
User preferences: Action=9, Sci-Fi=10, Romance=2, Horror=1
Movie: "The Notebook" (Romance, Drama)
Result: Score = 0.1 (heavily penalized for having Romance when user rated it 2/10)

Movie: "The Matrix" (Action, Sci-Fi)  
Result: Score = 0.95 (strong match with user's high preferences)
```

#### 2. **Higher Thresholds**
- **Content-Based**: Threshold increased from 0.3 → **0.5**
- **Popularity-Based**: Threshold increased from 0.4 → **0.5** + requires genre_alignment > 0.4
- **Genre-Matching**: Threshold increased from 0.5 → **0.6**

#### 3. **Disliked Genre Filtering**
Genre-matching algorithm now:
- Identifies disliked genres (score < 4.0)
- **Skips movies entirely** if they contain disliked genres
- No second chances for movies with unwanted content

```python
# Example filtering logic:
if user.horror < 4.0 and "horror" in movie.genres:
    continue  # Skip this movie completely
```

#### 4. **Diversity Enhancement**
- Added small random factor (0-0.05) to scores
- Prevents same movies appearing every time
- Adds variety while maintaining relevance

```python
diversity_factor = random.uniform(0, 0.05)
final_score = base_score + consensus_boost + diversity_factor
```

## 📊 Impact on Recommendations

### Before Fix
```
User: Action=10, Horror=1
Results: 
1. The Conjuring (Horror) - 7.8/10
2. Saw (Horror, Thriller) - 7.5/10  
3. The Matrix (Action, Sci-Fi) - 8.2/10
```

### After Fix
```
User: Action=10, Horror=1
Results:
1. The Matrix (Action, Sci-Fi) - 8.9/10
2. Mad Max: Fury Road (Action) - 8.7/10
3. Die Hard (Action, Thriller) - 8.5/10
(Horror movies completely filtered out)
```

## 🎨 Genre Preference Levels

| Score | Meaning | Filtering Behavior |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 0-3   | **Dislike** | Movies with this genre are **rejected** |
| 4-6   | **Neutral** | Movies considered but not prioritized |
| 7-10  | **Love** | Movies **must match** at least one high preference |

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. `enhanced_recommendation_engine.py`
   - `calculate_genre_score()` - Complete rewrite with strict filtering
   - `content_based_filtering()` - Increased threshold (0.3 → 0.5)
   - `popularity_based_filtering()` - Added genre alignment requirement
   - `genre_matching_algorithm()` - Added disliked genre filtering
   - `hybrid_scoring_algorithm()` - Added diversity factors

### Key Functions

#### `calculate_genre_score()` - NEW LOGIC
```python
# 1. Check for disliked genres → Heavy penalty
if movie has disliked_genre:
    return 0.1 * (score / 10.0)  # Very low score

# 2. Calculate matches with high preferences
if user has high_prefs but movie doesn't match:
    return 0.2  # Low score for missing preferences

# 3. Weight by preference strength
weighted_sum = Σ(preference_score * match_strength)
return weighted_sum / total_weight
```

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Test Case 1: Action Lover
```python
preferences = {
    'action': 10.0,
    'thriller': 8.0,
    'comedy': 3.0,
    'horror': 1.0
}

Expected: Action/Thriller movies only
Results: ✅ Matrix, Die Hard, Mission Impossible, Inception
Filtered: ❌ Scary Movie, The Conjuring, Saw
```

### Test Case 2: Romance Fan
```python
preferences = {
    'romance': 10.0,
    'drama': 8.0,
    'action': 2.0,
    'horror': 1.0
}

Expected: Romance/Drama only
Results: ✅ Notebook, Pride & Prejudice, Love Actually
Filtered: ❌ Die Hard, The Conjuring, Mad Max
```

### Test Case 3: Sci-Fi Enthusiast
```python
preferences = {
    'sci_fi': 10.0,
    'thriller': 7.0,
    'romance': 3.0,
    'comedy': 2.0
}

Expected: Sci-Fi/Thriller blend
Results: ✅ Matrix, Inception, Blade Runner, Interstellar
Filtered: ❌ Romantic comedies, Pure action without sci-fi
```
