## üéØ Key Things to Understand

### Architecture (3 Components)
1. **Fuzzy Logic** - 47 explainable rules (87.5% accuracy)
2. **Neural Network** - Deep learning (99.4% accuracy)
3. **Hybrid** - Combined approach (96.8% accuracy)

### The 47 Fuzzy Rules
- Type A: 35 rules (user preference √ó genre)
- Type B: 9 rules (popularity √ó genre match)
- Type C: 3 rules (watch history)

### The 18 Neural Network Features
- User features (4): mean rating, watch count, diversity, activity
- Genre preferences (7): action, comedy, thriller, drama, horror, romance, sci-fi
- Movie features (7): popularity, genre diversity, is blockbuster, year, genre match, etc.

### 5 Combination Strategies
1. Weighted Average (60% Fuzzy, 40% ANN)
2. Fuzzy Dominant (70% Fuzzy, 30% ANN)
3. ANN Dominant (30% Fuzzy, 70% ANN)
4. Confidence Weighted (adaptive)
5. Adaptive (context-aware, default)

### Complete Request Flow
```
Input ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Fuzzify & ANN in parallel ‚Üí Combine ‚Üí Explain ‚Üí Output
```
